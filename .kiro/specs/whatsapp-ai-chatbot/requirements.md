# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Django-based WhatsApp AI chatbot application. The system will enable users to interact with an AI assistant through WhatsApp by connecting to a configurable AI API. The application will handle incoming WhatsApp messages, forward them to the AI service, and return responses back to the user via WhatsApp.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: WhatsApp Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to send messages to a WhatsApp number, so that I can communicate with the AI assistant through my preferred messaging platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a message to the configured WhatsApp number THEN the system SHALL receive and process the incoming message
2. WHEN the system processes a response THEN the system SHALL send the response back to the user's WhatsApp number
3. WHEN a WhatsApp connection fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and return an appropriate error message
4. IF the WhatsApp service is unavailable THEN the system SHALL queue messages for retry

### Requirement 2: AI API Configuration

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure AI API credentials and settings, so that the application can connect to different AI services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator provides an AI API key THEN the system SHALL securely store the credentials
2. WHEN the system needs to make an AI request THEN the system SHALL use the configured API key for authentication
3. IF the API key is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return an error message indicating authentication failure
4. WHEN an administrator updates the AI API configuration THEN the system SHALL apply the new settings without requiring a restart

### Requirement 3: Message Processing and AI Interaction

**User Story:** As a user, I want my WhatsApp messages to be sent to the AI, so that I can receive intelligent responses to my questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user message is received THEN the system SHALL forward the message content to the configured AI API
2. WHEN the AI API returns a response THEN the system SHALL send the response back to the user via WhatsApp
3. IF the AI API request times out THEN the system SHALL notify the user that the request is taking longer than expected
4. WHEN multiple messages are sent in quick succession THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and process them in order
5. IF the AI API returns an error THEN the system SHALL send a user-friendly error message to the WhatsApp user

### Requirement 4: Conversation Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to remember our conversation context, so that I can have natural, continuous conversations with the AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends multiple messages THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history for that user
2. WHEN sending a request to the AI API THEN the system SHALL include relevant conversation context
3. IF a conversation is inactive for a configured period THEN the system SHALL clear the conversation history to save resources
4. WHEN a user starts a new conversation THEN the system SHALL create a new conversation session

### Requirement 5: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want user data and API credentials to be securely handled, so that sensitive information is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API credentials are stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt them at rest
2. WHEN user messages are processed THEN the system SHALL not log sensitive personal information
3. WHEN the system communicates with external APIs THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTPS connections
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL reject the request and log the attempt

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want comprehensive error logging and handling, so that I can troubleshoot issues and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error with timestamp, error type, and relevant context
2. WHEN a critical error occurs THEN the system SHALL notify administrators through configured channels
3. IF the system encounters an unexpected error THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle it and provide a user-friendly message
4. WHEN reviewing logs THEN administrators SHALL be able to filter by error severity, timestamp, and component

### Requirement 7: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to configure system settings through environment variables or a configuration file, so that I can easily deploy and manage the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL load configuration from environment variables or a configuration file
2. IF required configuration is missing THEN the system SHALL fail to start and provide clear error messages
3. WHEN configuration includes sensitive data THEN the system SHALL support loading from secure secret management systems
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL validate and report specific configuration errors
